##Assignment

In my opinion, this is the most demanding assignment in groups 1 - 3. The purpose is to represent an MP3 Library using linked lists. If you can tackle this without referencing other resources too much, you're well on your way!

Exploring these assignments between groups 1 and 3 has been a pleasure. Please feel free to make any suggestions or improvements, there are a few bugs that probably eluded my eyes as well of those of the graders who evaluated some of these programs.
