##Assignment 
Create a class, Tenant, containing methods and variables you so choose. In the main method, prompt the user for a number and then create an array of Tenants, prompting the user to enter values corresponding to certain fields. Then print all of the tenants and their information. Make sure to use getters and setters. In my example, the first monthly payment is a security deposit equal to one month's rent + the first months rent + the last month's rent.

Suggested fields: firstname, lastname, phone number, apt number, yearly rent.
Suggested methods: getMonthlyPayment, getFirstPayment
