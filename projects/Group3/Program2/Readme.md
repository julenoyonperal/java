##Assignment

Write a program that reads students scores, calculates the average and then assign grades based on each student's score and average. Like my other Java assignments, I like to leave the assignment open-ended. As long as your program is logically correct and doesn't contain any errors, it is correct as far as I am concerned. I think that providing the class names and the methods and variables associated with them takes the fun out of programming assignments.

As always, implementation is your prerogative.
