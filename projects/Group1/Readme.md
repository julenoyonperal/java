Group 1 has 11 Assignments

Description: A fantastic collection of practice assignments that could be worked through over the course of a semester (or a weekend). Only one program utilizes a GUI. The problems are easy to understand, not too difficult, and cover a lot of useful topics. I highly recommend this group.
