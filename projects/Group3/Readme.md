Group 3 has 9 Assignments
Description: Overall, this is a less rigorous collection than Group 1. Programs 3, 4, and 5 build upon each other. There are much less topics covered here and I recommend it as a supplement to Group 1, rather than a substitute. If you are stuck somewhere else, peeking at the answers to programs here can definitely be of help.
